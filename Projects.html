          <h2>Destiny Landing Page</h2>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            This was my very first project that I completed in the SheCodes bootcamp. Here I learned basic concepts of HTML and CSS. 
            The project was a simple landing page based on a hobby. I picked one of my favorite video games, and that gave me a 
            topic that I knew a lot about. This was the SheCodes Basic course which taught about HTML elements, and attributes. 
            It also taught about CSS properties, colors, positioning, and many other styles. Once I saw what I could create with 
            a little bit of code, I was eager to learn more.

          <h2>Travel Project</h2>
          <br />
          <p>This was one of my first projects with SheCodes. 
            After the completion of my landing page project, I was eager to jump into my second project. This project 
            was bringing in a new framework: Bootstrap. This project was a travel project, and I was very eager to complete it.
            This gave me a chance to showcase where I wanted to visit most: Switzerland. This project taught me how bootstap 
            could enhance a webpage, and how to make the page responsive. I also learned how using google locations could create maps,
            and how to adjust the CSS when viewing on different medias. The code is the same as when I completed it. 
            I wanted to focus on where I started compared to where I am now.

          <h2>Weather App</h2>
          <br />
          <p>This project gave me an in-depth view of JavaScript and the many ways it can transform a 
            webpage. I learned about JS events, APIs, selectors, dates, functions, and forms. I truly 
            enjoyed the outcome of this project and the different coding challenges that it put me through.

          <h2>React Dictionary App</h2>
          <br />
          <p>React has to be one of the most difficult libraries that I have ever had to learn. But, it challenged me 
            to push myself to new limits. It taught me about components, states, events, forms, and loops. What I found most
            intriguing was how JavaScript turned into JSX. I didn't understand it at first, but once I started applying what 
            I was learning it started to make sense.
